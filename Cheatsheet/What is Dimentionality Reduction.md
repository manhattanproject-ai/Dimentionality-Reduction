Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features (variables) in a dataset while retaining most of the essential information.

The goal is to simplify the model and make the data easier to work with, without losing significant insight.

## Why is Dimensionality Reduction Necessary?
This technique is primarily used to combat the "Curse of Dimensionality", a phenomenon where the performance of machine learning algorithms decreases as the number of features (dimensions) increases.

* Improves Model Performance: By removing redundant or irrelevant features, you make the model simpler, faster to train, and less prone to overfitting.
* Reduces Computation Time: Fewer dimensions mean less processing power and time are needed to run algorithms and store data.
* Enhances Visualization: Data with three or fewer dimensions can be easily plotted and visualized, which is crucial for human understanding and exploratory data analysis.
* Mitigates Multicollinearity: It helps handle highly correlated features, which can destabilize model coefficients.
